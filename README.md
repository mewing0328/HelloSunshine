### Tasks Completed 
```
HTML & CSS: Used Bootstrap to build out the HTML elements. I utilized CSS to modify the Bootstrap foundation for my styling preference.

JavaScript: Used JQuery in my code and accessed openweathermap.org for utilizing an API.
* Provided search capabilities to present current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* Displayed the current date and the next 5 days for the weather dashboard
* Enabled a search history feature for the dashboard for previously searched cities
* Used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data
* Used `localStorage` to store persistent data
```
